This is the repository for the Contract-LIB website.

We use Jekyll for static site generation and GitHub pages for publishing. For more information, see https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll.

The preview it locally, run `bundle install` and `bundle exec jekyll serve` (requires Jekyll, see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
Afterwards, the preview can be viewed with a browser under `http://localhost:4000`.
